// declare constant with const keyword


const pi = 3.14;
// in this case we are declaring a constant with const keyword
// we cannot change value of const/constant after declaring it
// pi = 3.15; // invalid // error
//but after declareing a constant we can do other stuffs like we can do sum, sub, mul, div etc but we cannot change the value of constant after declaring it
console.log(pi);
